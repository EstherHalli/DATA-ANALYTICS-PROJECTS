### Project 2 : HR Analytics PowerBi Dashboard (https://github.com/EstherHalli/DATA-ANALYTICS-PROJECTS/tree/main/HR-Analytics-PowerBi-Dashboard-Files)
Created an interactive dashboard using Power BI to help an organization to improve employee performance and improve employee retention(reduce attrition). Used parameters to drill down into worksheet and customization using filters and slicers. Used different types of customized visualization(Cards, Treemap, Matrix, Stached Bar Chart, Area Chart, Donut Chart, Stacked Column Chart). 

Tasks Performed:
- Downloaded the Dataset from Kaggle.
- Fetch Data in #CSV format to Power Bi Desktop.
- Transformed data to desired form using Power Query(Removed Columns, Removed Duplicates, Replaced Values, Changed data type, Added Conditional Column).
- Performed ETL operations.
- Used DAX functions to calculate Attrition rate.
- Create report using tooltip & measures for Attrition rate %.
- Implemented KPI's to visually represent and provide insights like Total Employees, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate, Avg Age, Avg Salary and Avg Years at company of employees who have resigned.
- Added Slicer, Cards, Treemap, Matrix, Stached Bar Chart, Area Chart, Donut Chart, Stacked Column Chart to analyse on the attrition by education, age, years at company, salary, job title and job 
  satisfaction.

### Project 3 : E-Commerce Sales Analysis using Python (https://github.com/EstherHalli/DATA-ANALYTICS-PROJECTS/tree/main/E-Commerce-Python-Files)
This data analysis project focused on analyzing Ecommerce sales data using popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib. The goal of this project was to gain insights into sales trends in different cities of a country over a year and boost revenue.

Tasks Performed:
- Gathered dataset from Kaggle.
- Performed in-depth analysis on E-commerce sales data to uncover hidden patterns, customer preferences, and market trends.
- Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), aimed to gain a better understanding of how sales can be increased by attracting more customers through the improved marketing strategy or by lowering the costs 
  of products sold.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas to ensure accurate analysis.
- Created informative visualizations using Matplotlib to present sales trends.
- Explored correlations between different variables to uncover patterns in sales data.

### Project 4 : Hotel Booking Data Analysis using Python(https://github.com/EstherHalli/DATA-ANALYTICS-PROJECTS/tree/main/Hotel-Booking-Python)
This Hotel Booking data analysis project focused on analyzing the booking cancellation rates for city and resort hotel using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly. The goal of this project was to gain insights into the cancellation trends in city and resort hotel and different country over a year. To help to lower the cancellation rates in hotels in order to increase their efficiency in increasing the revenue.

Tasks Performed:
1. Data Collection : Gathered dataset from Kaggle.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing : Read the CSV file using Pandas. Changed the datatypes of the columns, removed the null values, unnecessary columns and outliers.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) :
- Analysed and visualised the cancellation rates for the hotels, average daily rate for the hotel over the years, reservation status per month, average daily rate per month for the cancelled state. 
- Visualized to get the top countried for the reservation cancelled status. Tried to gain insights of market segment, the mode through which the reservations are made.
- Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), aimed to gain a better understanding of how cancellation rates can be decreased by attracting more customers through the improved marketing strategy, by lowering the reservation costs, hotels can be assisted in pricing and promotional decisions, increasing the facilities in rooms, provide discount which will eventually reduce the ideal hotel room use and boost the revenue.
