   - Created a database and imported the flat files to MS SQL Server.
   - Establised a connection between Power BI and MS SQL DB.
   - Imported data to Power BI Desktop.
2. Data Cleaning and Transformation :
   - Performed ETL operations in POwer Query.
   - Cleansed the data to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and format it correctly for analysis.
3. Data Modeling:
   - Developed a data model that established the relationships between different data tables for accurate analysis.
4. Data Visulaisation:
   - Created KPI's showing YTD Sales, YTD Profit, YTD Quantity sold, YTD Profit Margin.
   - YOY growth for each KPI and a YTD sparkline for each measure in the KPI to understand monthly trend for each fact.
   - Created Matrix to find the YTD Sales, PYTD Sales, YoY Sales growthalond with trend icon for different customer category.
   - Created a Map to show the YTD Sales performance by each State.
   - Stacked bar chart to show the top5 and bottom 5 products by sales.
   - Donut chart to represent the YTD Sales by region to show the best and worst performing region all over country.
   - Donut chart to show YTD Sales by shipping type to get the best shipping type percentage.

### Project 3 : E-Commerce Sales Analysis using Python (https://github.com/EstherHalli/DATA-ANALYTICS-PROJECTS/tree/main/E-Commerce-Python-Files)
This data analysis project focused on analyzing Ecommerce sales data using popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib. The goal of this project was to gain insights into sales trends in different cities of a country over a year and boost revenue.

Tasks Performed:
- Gathered dataset from Kaggle.
- Performed in-depth analysis on E-commerce sales data to uncover hidden patterns, customer preferences, and market trends.
- Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), aimed to gain a better understanding of how sales can be increased by attracting more customers through the improved marketing strategy or by lowering the costs 
  of products sold.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas to ensure accurate analysis.
- Created informative visualizations using Matplotlib to present sales trends.
- Explored correlations between different variables to uncover patterns in sales data.

### Project 4 : Hotel Booking Data Analysis using Python(https://github.com/EstherHalli/DATA-ANALYTICS-PROJECTS/tree/main/Hotel-Booking-Python)
This Hotel Booking data analysis project focused on analyzing the booking cancellation rates for city and resort hotel using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly. The goal of this project was to gain insights into the cancellation trends in city and resort hotel and different country over a year. To help to lower the cancellation rates in hotels in order to increase their efficiency in increasing the revenue.

Tasks Performed:
1. Data Collection : Gathered dataset from Kaggle.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing : Read the CSV file using Pandas. Changed the datatypes of the columns, removed the null values, unnecessary columns and outliers.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) :
   - Analysed and visualised the cancellation rates for the hotels, average daily rate for the hotel over the years, reservation status per month, average daily rate per month for the cancelled state. 
   - Visualized to get the top countried for the reservation cancelled status. Tried to gain insights of market segment, the mode through which the reservations are made.
   - Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), aimed to gain a better understanding of how cancellation rates can be decreased by attracting more customers through the improved marketing strategy, by 
     lowering the reservation costs, hotels can be assisted in pricing and promotional decisions, increasing the facilities in rooms, provide discount which will eventually reduce the ideal hotel room use 
     and boost the revenue.
